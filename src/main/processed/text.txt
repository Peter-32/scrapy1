 Here are the groups for which we are hiring:

INTEGRITY Real-time Operating System:Create, upgrade and maintain components of the INTEGRITY memory protected real-time operating system, such as device drivers, board support packages, networking stacks, other native application code, ports of third-party application code, or even the kernel itself.

Projects in this area require familiarity with interfacing directly to hardware and with multi-threaded programming.

We build the highest performance debug probes supporting the broadest range of target CPUs. Members of this group are embedded programmers who use C and VHDL, but are also comfortable with extending our MULTI IDE to support new debugging concepts.  Hardware experience and knowledge are welcome, but not necessary.
Advanced Products: Working closely with sales, engineers in the Advanced Products group will work across all of our products to develop solutions for our customers. Create, upgrade, and maintain products targeting the specific requirements of our customers. Work with customers and sales channels to establish requirements for future product development and participate in the design, development, implementation, and integration of those new solutions. Engineers in this group have a unique opportunity to help develop a complete solution, that combines technologies from across multiple product lines to address specific customer requirements. This position comes with the opportunity for business related travel.

Requirements:

Strong programming skills in C/C++ required 
Must be working toward or possess a BS/MS (CS, ECE, Math) or have 5+ yrs experience in the embedded software industry

Senior Project Manager - Experience Planning

Department:
              Hardware
            
Location:
              Santa Barbara
            

Req#:
              5466
            

At Sonos we are passionate about inspiring the world to listen better. Whether it’s a new release on Spotify, the latest edition of the Daily, or that award winning series on Netflix, we believe that when people listen better they live better. We strive to bring that mission to life by providing our customers with a best-in-class experience. The Experience Planning group plays a key role in this work, conducting explorations that progress our experience and differentiate Sonos’ products and services. If you are a passionate explorer with a desire to change the status quo, read on.Within Experience Planning (XP), the Portfolio Planning team brings a product management perspective to explorations.  Our goal is to drive awareness, understanding, and a point-of-view on new portfolio opportunities.  We work with partners in Experience Planning, HW and SW Product Management, Product Development, and Go To Market (GTM) to explore new opportunities and make recommendations on future products and experiences based on the desirability to the customer, feasibility of required technologies, and viability of the opportunity in terms of investment and return.This work is often loosely defined and ambiguous at the onset.  Its processes are therefore experimental, making them difficult to structure, and rarely with linear guidelines.  But without structure, there is chaos.  And with chaos comes waste.  That’s where you come in…




About You


More than a candidate that checks every box, we’re looking for people who are excited to work, learn, and grow at Sonos—no matter their background or how they identify. If that’s you, we hope you’ll apply for this role.
You want to be part of a team.
You come with new ideas and a unique point of view. You look forward to collaborating with a diverse team of individuals. You assume everyone’s best intentions, welcome a healthy debate, and embrace differing opinions. You eagerly seek and give help. Transparency tops your list of values, and you proactively contribute to a culture of respect and inclusion.
You enjoy a challenge.
Inquisitive and focused, you see every challenge as an opportunity. You’re ambitious and comfortable making mistakes because you learn from them and bounce back quickly. You would rather create the future than wait for it. You prioritize long-term value over short-term objectives.
You love to listen.
You approach every interaction with curiosity and a desire to understand. You want to make a positive impact in the world. You’re passionate about culture and know the power that music, film, podcasts, games, and stories have to bring people together.


What You’ll Do
